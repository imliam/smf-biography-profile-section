The Biography Profile Section Modification adds a new section to member's profiles. Aswell as being able to enter their details, Date of Birth, etcetera, they will also now be able to enter a Biography about themselves. This biography is displayed in their profile, so other users can see what they have put down.

This modification installs through the Package Manager. If anything goes wrong, go to the Support Topic and install the code hacks manually. It only edits small parts of a single file, so nothing should go wrong however.
